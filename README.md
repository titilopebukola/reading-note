A growth mindset is a positive mindset. It is an ability to always think positive and believing in one's true self.

It is a mindset that welcome criticism and always ready to take feedbacks onboard and strive to improve.

With a growth mindset, one see failure as an opportunity to learn a better way of doing thing, an avenue to improve and become better version of oneself.

Three Reminders to myself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
- Never give up on difficult task.
- Every mistake is an opportunity to get better
- The fact that I don't get it now doesn't mean I can't get it later.
